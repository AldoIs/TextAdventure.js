# TextAdventure.js

TextAdventure.js is a text adventure engine that runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and makes use of [Express](http://expressjs.com/). The project has four main components; a simple server, a retro command line inspired web interface known as the Terminal, the text adventure engine itself colloquially called the Console and then the games themselves which are made up of two Javascript objects. Each of these components is further explained in their respective section below.
